Simulation has been initialized
Selected Top-Level: multiplexor4_1 (DSMB)
KERNEL: stopped at time: 2 ms
 reached  the maximum simulation time (2ms) allowed in any single simulation run.  The effective length of the simulation may be extended by running multiple simulations in increments of 2ms.  To upgrade your software to handle simulations greater than this time as well as VHDL source level simulation contact Aldec - sales@aldec.com
